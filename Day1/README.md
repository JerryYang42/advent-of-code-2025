# About

This is my solution to [Advent of Code Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1).

## Progress
Cracked Day 1 in a hacky way. 

TODOs:
- extract the logic into functions
- add unit tests with test data set
- use online data instead of data file

## How to run

```bash
uv init

python3 Day1/src/main/P1.py
```
